Ash3d
----------------------------------
Test airport files with projected values
Test supplementing the global file.
Test replacing the global file.
Test having sample points (non-airports)
Test projecting (or not) airport list

Add outflow to netcdf output file.  Needed for restart cases.

DepositGranularity should be part of tephra and only over n_gs_max, not identical to outflow_xy1_pd

Add limits to iteration of vset so as to prevent run-away iterations.

Add Albers to projection list
Add new VOTW numbers to current database
Add max z as optional parameter on line 7
Fix dz_clog and dz_cuts
Change 3d ascii output to include deposit separately.

Add ip and op to argument lists to nail down interface blocks.
Verify that all allocated variables are deallocated.
Add a check for cwd in MetReader to give full paths to windfiles (needed in Win)

Add tool to recreate input file from netcdf file
Investigate all overflow/underflow errors
Test timing of do loops reversed; particularly with openMP


----------------------------------
Ash3d_PostProc
----------------------------------
Make sure the colors are as specified for both plplot and dislin
Check out gmt for fortran
write GMT subroutine that export script file

Confirm preferred shapefile specifications
 name? : ; limited to 8 char
 polylineM, polylineZ, add point with ESP's, check record type, available via URL,
 proj, dBASE version

Add command-file option

Add custom contour levels

Check ASCII output

Add ability to convert ascii to png or shapefile

Make sure all the postproc utilities work with projected grids too, including citywriter.

Allow postproc program to read from input file and allow:
  reading of 3d  binary data
  loading 2d ASCII or binary data and allowing plots or other 2d output
  Must have sections in the input file to allow for meta data normally pulled from netcdf
  Add exposure output product when given flight path
